1.create workspace in home directory (preferably) than in ros directory.
cmd : mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/indigo/foundation_course/src

2. naviagte to src\ and run cmd : catkin_init_workspace

3.Now go one folder back and run cmd: catkin_make

4. comment out enable_anaconda in .bashrc # reason no idea.

5. add custom workspace setup path ~/ros_ws/indigo/foundation_course_ws/devel/setup.sh to .bashrc file. #reason : to redirect roscd from default ros_ws to custom workspace (choice)

6. create package in src\ folder
   cmd : catkin_create_package <package_name> <direct_dependency>

7. modify the CMakeLists.txt and package.xml files accordingly

8. to start ros master server : roscore(in diff terminal)

9. rosrun <package_name> <filename>

10. rqt_graph : visualization tool for communication between nodes.

11. ros_spin() : method for inifinte loop(commonly used to keep a node running)

12. steps to create python module :
	*add a setup.py file at same level as the src\ .
	*add a __init__.py file inside the src\.
	*run following command : sudo python setup.py install 
	# the above command will add your custom python module to the default		# path slo that you are module can be accessed from other modules  		# without having to worry about the Path config.

13. to ignore a package while compiling add CATKIN_IGNORE file in the desired package.

14. to compile a single package : catkin_make --pkg <package_name>
